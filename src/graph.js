  /**
   * Dependency graphs emerge from one or more entry nodes. The ability to
   * distinguish an entry node from a normal dependency node allows us to
   * aggressively prune a node and all of its dependencies.
   *
   * As a basic example of why the concept is important, if `a -> b -> c`
   * and we want to prune `b`, we know that we can safely prune `c` as well.
   *
   * But if `a -> b -> c -> a` and we want to prune `b`, then we need to know
   * that `a` is an entry node, so that we don't traverse the cyclic graph
   * and prune every node.
   *
   * This concept becomes increasingly important once we start dealing with
   * more complicated cyclic graphs, as pruning can result in disconnected
   * sub-graphs. For example, if we have `a -> b -> c -> d -> b` and we want
   * to prune `a`, we can't safely prune `b -> c -> d -> b` as well, as `b`
   * has a dependent `d`. However, if we don't prune them, then they are
   * left disconnected from the other nodes.
   *
   * Hence we need to know a graph's entry points so that we can traverse it
   * from the entries and find the nodes which are disconnected
